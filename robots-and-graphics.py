    2a. Makes the given robot go straight the given number of centimeters
          at the given speed (in centimeters per second), then stop.
            -- Positive centimeters means go forward
            -- Negative centimeters means go backwards.

          -- Displays the image of the robot, moving horizontally
               across the window as the robot goes.
               The displayed motion is proportional to the actual distance
               traveled; you can use 1 pixel per millimeter if you wish,
               or you can use another reasonable scaling factor.

               in the zg.Text object.  The Text refreshes but does NOT move.
        Query the robot for its distance and redraw periodically;
        details are up to you.
